    <description>This mod makes every single floor in the game XL. (Except for Hush, Womb II, Void, Depths II (though in a regular run you can't reach Depths II/Womb II without using we need to go deeper, but removed just in case) Greedier, and Challenge mode as that crashes or softlocks the game. I also made black candle a random item.)</description>
